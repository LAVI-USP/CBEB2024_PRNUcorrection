The proposed method estimates the Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) map from flat-field mammography images and applies a correction step prior to denoising. The objective is to reduce the influence of structural noise, improving the balance between noise suppression and signal preservation in indirect-conversion digital mammography systems.

## Repository contents

The repository includes MATLAB scripts for:

- Estimation of the PRNU map from multiple flat-field images;
- Structural noise correction;
- Estimation of the quadratic noise model parameters;
- Quantitative evaluation of the denoising performance;
- Reproduction of the figures and results presented in the publication.

## Requirements

The code was developed and tested using:

- MATLAB R2025b

Required toolboxes:

- Image Processing Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

---

## Method overview

The implemented framework follows the workflow below:

1. Acquire multiple flat-field mammography images;
2. Estimate the detector PRNU map;
3. Apply the PRNU correction to the mammography image;
4. Estimate the noise model parameters;
5. Perform image denoising;
6. Evaluate restoration quality using quantitative metrics.
